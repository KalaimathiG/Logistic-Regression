# Fish Species Classification
  Aim of this project is to create a model that classifies the species of fishes based on the Input data
  
 # Resource
 Fish market dataset available at https://www.kaggle.com/aungpyaeap/fish-market is the source data.
 
 # Packages used
 Numpy,Pandas,Seaborn,Matplotlib,sklearn have been used for data visualization,model development.
 
 # EDA
 
 Dataset has been imported and analysed , here are some of the interesting analysis.

 #Model building 
 Logistic Regression has been implemented using Sklearn
 
 #Evaluation
 score of the model is 0.75 which means 7.5 data out of 10 are predicted correctly
